## Introduction
- Leverage external MAC+PHY modules to give your microcontroller Ethernet capabilities—without the headache.
- Optimize your system’s performance by offloading the TCP/IP stack to the W5500, freeing up your microcontroller for what it does best.
- Build robust, scalable systems that can handle multiple connections and real-world industrial use cases.

## Main purpose 
- Develop optimized Ethernet drivers using external MAC+PHY modules like the W5500 to enhance embedded system performance and free up microcontroller resources.
- Design, build, and deploy HTTP servers on microcontrollers to enable remote hardware control via web interfaces.
- Create scalable and reliable TCP/IP clients and servers for high-speed data transmission.
- Master advanced socket programming techniques for smooth, high-performance communication.
- Control hardware over TCP Clients and Servers.

## Hardware module
- STM32F411RE and W550 Ethernet Module
